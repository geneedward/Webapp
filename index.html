4. Click **"Commit changes"**

## **Step 2: Check Your Branch Name**

From your image, I see you're using **`main`** branch (it's in the command: `git branch -m main`), so Netlify should be set to `main`. But let's verify:

1. Go to **Netlify** → your site → **Site settings** → **Build & deploy**
2. Under "Production branch", make sure it says `main`
3. If it already says `main`, leave it as is

## **Step 3: Trigger a New Deploy**

After uploading files to GitHub:

1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click **"Deploys"** tab
3. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Deploy site"**

## **Step 4: Check the Result**

Wait 1-2 minutes, then:
1. Click on the new deploy in Netlify
2. If it succeeds, click **"Preview"** to see your site
3. Or visit your custom domain if you've set it up

## **If You Still Get Errors:**

Go to Netlify → **Deploys** → click on the failed build to see detailed error messages. Common issues:

1. **No `index.html` file** - Make sure you have this file
2. **Wrong build settings** - For basic HTML sites, you don't need build commands
   - In Netlify: Build & deploy → Build settings
   - **Build command:** (leave empty for HTML sites)
   - **Publish directory:** `./` (or leave as is)

## **Quick Checklist:**
- [ ] Upload `index.html` to GitHub
- [ ] Netlify branch = `main`
- [ ] Trigger new deploy
- [ ] Check deploy logs for errors

**Do you have website files ready to upload, or do you need to create a basic website first?**
